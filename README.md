# Assessing the Effectiveness of Medical Treatments: Logistic Regression and Kidney Stones

I completed this project through DataCamp using R.

### Content
- `kidney_stone_data.csv` is the dataset used for this project
- `kidney_stone.ipynb` is the Jupyter notebook

### Abstract
This projects investigates the significance of two treatments and the sizes of the kidney stones using multiple logistic regression. The data is from 1 1986 research paper published by urologists in The British Medical Journal. The goal of the project is to investigate whether or not Treatment A (invasive) is a better treatment than Treatment B (less invasive) as well as if the size of the kidney stone affected the likelihood of treatment success.
